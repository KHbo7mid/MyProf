# MyProf RAG application 

MyProf is a web app where a student uploads PDFs (lecture notes, papers, textbooks) and gets:

* accurate Q&A grounded in the PDF,

* chapter and slide summarization,

* flashcards & quizzes,

* table and figure extraction,

* highlight & shareable notes,

all powered by RAG. Nice UI for students and teachers.
